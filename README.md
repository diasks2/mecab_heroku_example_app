MeCab | Heroku Sample App
=======

This is a simple sample app to try and get MeCab working on Heroku using this buildpack:  
https://github.com/diasks2/heroku-buildpack-mecab  

The vendor binary is available here:

A big thank you to [@jkatzer](https://github.com/jkatzer) for all his help in getting this working.
